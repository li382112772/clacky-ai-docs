# Introduction

Clacky offers a brand-new AI autonomous programming solution that can help users with requirements or bugs of various sizes. In our product, we emphasize the ability to interact deeply with human users, obtaining guidance and feedback from them.

## Key Concepts

Let's quickly familiarize ourselves with the core concepts of Clacky:

**Marvin**: Clacky's AI virtual software engineer, capable of independent development while also serving as an assistant.

**Workspace**: A collaborative environment where you, your team members, and Clacky AI work together.

**Thread**: A dedicated task space for addressing a single issue.

**Project**: A collection of all threads within a project.

**CDE (Cloud Development Environment)**: A cloud-based, innovative development environment designed from the ground up, serving as both a development platform and runtime environment for AI agents.

### FAQ

1. **Designed for who?**
     
     Clacky is designed for teams, which is why we have incorporated numerous collaboration features. At the same time, we envision users building serious product applications on Clacky, or iterating on the features and requirements of existing projects. We place a high emphasis on the quality of work outcomes, avoiding the creation of toy-like code quality.
<br/>
2. **How do i get started?**
     
     Once your application is approved, you become an invited beta user of Clacky. You will receive an email containing an activation code and a registration link. Using this link and the invitation code, you can register for Clacky and start using it.
<br/>
3. **How do you ensure the success rate of AI’s work?**
     
     We have developed a robust AI Agent work model that can perform in-depth analysis and indexing of project code repositories. Coupled with a mature workflow, this significantly enhances the quality of the "first" work output. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive human intervention solution, allowing for feedback and guidance during Clacky's operation, and even direct intervention in  detailscode for adjustments (without switching to a local environment).
<br/>
4. **What if I don’t satisfy with AI’s work?**
     
     When the AI’s work is not up to par, you can pause the AI’s work at any time for adjustments. In addition to directly modifying the code, we natively provide code generation and code completion functions to more conveniently intervene in the AI’s work results.]
<br/>
5. **Can I share session with others?**
     
     Of course, we have specifically optimized the system for code review scenarios. You can invite the users you wish to collaborate with for review by clicking the invitation button in the upper right corner. All operations are shared among users, facilitating analysis and communication of issues between you.
<br/>
6. **Does it cost to use Clacky?**
     
     During the product beta testing phase, Clacky offers its services for free. We hope you can establish a deep communication relationship with us, providing valuable feedback to help us continuously optimize the product. After the beta phase ends, we will introduce a paid plan, and you will need to pay for the premium version.
<br/>
7. **Can I switch AI Copilot mode in Clacky?**
     
     Of course, even if the AI is generating the code, ultimately these work results belong to you. This means you can deeply participate in or modify the work code that Clacky has done for you. To this end, we provide a Copilot mode that allows you to directly provide feedback on code issues through natural language and adjust the optimization results.
