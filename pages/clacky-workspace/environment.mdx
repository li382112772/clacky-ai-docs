# Environment

Clacky provides a pre-configured, independent cloud development environment for each Development Thread. This includes database services bound to the main development container of the Development Thread, such as [MySQL](/cloud-services/Mysql), which can be directly installed and connected for use.

The aim is to offer a seamless setup where, after connecting to a remote repository and importing project code, the AI can automatically initialize the development environment without manual configuration.

Currently, Clacky supports the following language frameworks and database services:

| Language | Framework |
| :---------- | :----------- |
| Node.js | Next.js, Vue, React, Angular, Express, Static(HTML/CSS/JS)|
| Golang | Gin |
| Python | Django, Flask, Fastapi |
| Ruby | Rails |

| Database Services | Version |
| :---------- | :----------- |
| MySQL | 8.0.37 |
| PostgreSQL | 1.37 |
| Redis | 7.2.4 |
| MongoDB | 2.2.5 |

In the Thread development container, we utilize two package managers to handle different types of dependencies:

- **Nix**: Used for core development dependencies such as Node.js and its runtime tools. [Nix](https://nixos.org/) ensures consistency and reproducibility across environments by providing precise version control and isolation. This is essential for development dependencies that are frequently updated or vary between projects.

- **apt**: Employed for system-level packages and tools that require stability and are widely used, including databases and network utilities. apt takes advantage of Ubuntu's package management system to ensure security and reliability.
