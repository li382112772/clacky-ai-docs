# Development Thread

![project](public/assets/thread.png)

A Development Thread in Clacky is an independent development environment organized using git branches, designed to handle one development task at a time. It allows for focused work on specific issues or features within a project.

## Key Features

- **Isolated Environment**: Each thread functions within its own cloud-based development environment, ensuring that changes remain isolated and do not impact other parts of the project until they are merged.

- **Pre-configured Setup**: When creating a new thread, you will fork the Default Thread and clone the project's default branch code, allowing you to start working immediately without any additional configuration.

- **Enhanced Collaboration**: Team members can collaborate effectively within a thread, utilizing Clacky's AI capabilities to efficiently address project issues.


## Workflow for Development Threads

1. **Initiate a Conversation**: Start by discussing the task requirements with Clacky. The AI will help generate a detailed specification based on your input.

2. **Start a Thread**: Once the specification is ready, initiate a new development thread. This sets up a dedicated environment for the task.

3. **Work with Clacky**: Collaborate with Clacky to write code, solve problems, and refine the task. The AI's robust work model ensures thorough analysis and indexing of the project code.

4. **Submit Changes**: After completing the task, use the Git Agent to submit your changes and create a pull request for review and integration into the main project.
