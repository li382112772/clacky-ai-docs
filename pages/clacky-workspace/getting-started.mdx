# Getting Started

Upon successful registration, we create an initial Workspace for each user. This collaborative environment allows you, your team members, and Clacky AI to work together seamlessly. Within this workspace, you can create projects and collaborate with Marvin, Clacky's AI virtual software engineer, to address real issues in your projects.

### Creating a Project

To create a project, simply connect to an existing repository:

Currently, we only support connecting to GitHub repositories. Support for GitLab and BitBucket is in the pipeline, so stay tuned for these upcoming features.


### Initializing the Clacky Development Environment

Before creating threads and collaborating with Marvin on specific project issues, we need to set up the development environment for your project. This process is similar to configuring a local development environment, but with Clacky, it's much simpler. Just follow the prompts and click confirm - Marvin will autonomously handle the configuration work.

Once Marvin completes the setup, you'll need to submit these initial changes as a Pull Request to GitHub and merge them into your project's default branch. This ensures that the initialization is automatically applied to all subsequent threads.

### How to create a new thread

Creating a new thread is as simple as chatting with Marvin. Marvin will automatically identify task requirements and create a Specification based on your conversation. Once everything looks good, click the button to create a new thread.
