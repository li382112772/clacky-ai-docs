# Smart Detect Agent

The Smart Detect Agent is an AI-assisted debugging tool provided by Clacky, designed to help users identify and fix errors in their projects. With this feature, users can receive proactive error detection and correction suggestions from the AI and decide whether to send these suggestions back to the AI for further assistance.

## Key Features

- **Error Detection and Reporting**: Smart Detect automatically checks for errors in the project and generates a detailed report. If no errors are found, the system will notify the user and monitor for runtime errors; if errors are detected, the system will provide suggestion messages.

- **AI Error Correction**: Users can choose to send the suggestion messages to the AI, which will analyze the errors and generate correction steps. Users can modify the suggestions in the input box before sending them to the AI for processing.

## Workflow

1. **Enable Smart Detect**: After a task is successfully completed, click the "Start Smart Detect" button to enable AI-assisted debugging.

2. **Error Detection**: Smart Detect will automatically check for errors in the project and generate a report.

3. **AI Correction**: Users can choose to send the error information and suggestions to the AI, which will analyze and generate correction steps and execute them autonomously.

4. **Task Execution**: After the errors are corrected, the AI will autonomously run the project to ensure all changes have been correctly applied and verify if the errors have been truly resolved.
